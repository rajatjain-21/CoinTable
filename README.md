# CoinTable
A development excercise covering fundamentals of React (including routing, data fetching, working with forms, etc). It is a really good start to someone who is familiar with react and want to learn more and  be more hands on. The app that I am building here uses real API to get upto date financial data about cryptocurrencies. The app also has functionalities like pagination and autocomplete search. This exercise will give you a familiarity with structuring real world React apps, styling React components and learn new features of ES6.
